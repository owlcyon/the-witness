Now You Need to VALIDATE This:
Since you've marked everything as "DONE," you need to verify the implementation actually works. Here's your Production Validation Checklist:

1. Infrastructure Validation:
bash
# Test 1: Docker Compose
docker-compose up -d
docker-compose ps  # All services should be "Up"

# Test 2: Database
docker-compose exec db psql -U postgres -d witness -c "\dx"
# Should show pgvector extension

# Test 3: Redis
docker-compose exec redis redis-cli PING
# Should return "PONG"

# Test 4: Application
curl http://localhost:8000/health
# Should return 200 with DB/Redis connectivity check
2. Authentication Test:
bash
# Test registration
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","username":"testuser","password":"SecurePass123!"}'
# Should return JWT tokens

# Test login with same credentials
# Test protected endpoint with token
3. Core Functionality Test:
bash
# Test vector similarity
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/memes/ingest \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"content":"test meme","source":"test"}'

# Test graph query
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/graph/nodes \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
4. Monitoring Validation:
bash
# Test Prometheus metrics
curl http://localhost:8000/metrics
# Should return metrics in Prometheus format

# Test Grafana (if exposed)
# Open http://localhost:3000
# Login with admin/admin (or configured credentials)
